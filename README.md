# Patch_Match_python
The algorithm of patch match implemented by python
# Introduction
This code mainly implement the algorithm of patch match, for details, please see the paper: [PatchMatch: A Randomized Correspondence Algorithm for Structural Image Editing](http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/pubs/Barnes_2009_PAR/patchmatch.pdf)

About this code: PatchMatch_V0.py is much slower than PatchMatch.py, but the result is better.
